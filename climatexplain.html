    <h1>What is Climate Change?</h1>
   <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels (like coal, oil and gas) which produces heat-trapping greenhouse gases.</p>
    <p class="important">Key aspects of climate change include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="important">Global Warming:</span> The increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Greenhouse Effect:</span> The process by which certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat that would otherwise escape into space, thus warming the Earth.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Changes in Precipitation:</span> Some regions are experiencing more intense rainfall and flooding, while others are becoming drier, increasing the risk of droughts.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Sea Level Rise:</span> The increase in the average global sea level due to thermal expansion of water and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets.</li>
        <li><span class="important">Extreme Weather Events:</span> Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves, hurricanes, droughts, and other severe weather events.</li>
    </ul>
